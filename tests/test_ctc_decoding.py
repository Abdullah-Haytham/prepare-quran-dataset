"""Chunk-boundary CTC contracts for :mod:`ctc_decoding`.

These run without torch, nemo, or a model — the collapse rules are pure integer
manipulation, and they are exactly the part of the streaming path that is easy to get
subtly wrong.  The live mic app asserts the same equivalence at runtime ("per-chunk log
concatenates to transcript"); this file makes it a permanent guard.

Runnable two ways, so it works in CI and on a machine without the GPU stack::
